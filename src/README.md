# C4 Compiler Rewritten in Rust

## Objective:
Building on your analysis of the C4 compiler from Assignment 1, your team will rewrite the
C4 compiler in Rust. The Rust version must compile the same subset of C code as the
original C4 compiler (e.g., the C4 source code itself), maintaining its self-hosting capability
and core functionality. This project leverages Rustâ€™s safety, modern features, and
performance to reimplement the compiler, ensuring equivalence to the original while
improving design where possible.

## How to Build & Run: 
### Prerequisites
- Rust (Install via [https://rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjxko/c4_rust_Dibba-Al-Hisn.git
cd c4_rust_Dibba-Al-Hisn
